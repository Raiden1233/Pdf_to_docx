# IMPORTANT
> I am assuming you have python installed already if not, **install python first** *before* using the script. If you are in windows be sure to check **PATH** thing, when running the setup. 
# Pdf_to_docx
> A script to convert pdf file into docx/document
# Required modules
> **Install the *pdf2docx* python module before running the script**.
Copy and paste this command to install pdf2docx module: `pip install pdf2docx` in powershell or cmd to run this command ( terminal if you have it ).
